## Search work telegram bot

Hi, i wanna to create my project for searching work.
In project will be 3 part:
1) Telegram bot
2) server on Django
3) BD (postgre or sqlite)

In project, I'm planning two big parts. At first part will path for users, which want to
find job. In the future, will be part for people who want to find new workers.

For begin, I'm going to make part, where user will be able to create short resume (for begin).
Models you can find at ./backend/src/search_work/models.py. 
I assume those fields will be enough for beginning.

Stage:
1) (Now) Create models.
